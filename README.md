Module 2 Challenge: This program is a Restaurant Menu for a food truck that allows customers/users to select multiple menu items and sub menu options. This program stores those chosen items in a list that contains dictionaries and at the end of the program it displays the items ordered and the total cost based on quantities and selection of itme in the menu.
